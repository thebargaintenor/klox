# klox

This is a very much unfinished Kotlin implementation of Bob Nystrom's Lox language as described
in *[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com)*.  I'm still working through it.

In fact... I'm still so rusty with Kotlin that I don't even have a proper Makefile yet and just
let Idea do the heavy lifting. This is a learning project. Don't worry about it.
